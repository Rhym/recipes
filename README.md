2. Bacon
3. Garlic
4. Onion
5. Dried Chillies
6. Mixed Herbs
7. Chicken stock
8. Cream
9. Flour
10. Creamed corn 
11. Squash and/potato/or whatever root veges you fancy (lol root)

### Steps

1. Mince your garlic & Onion, biff in your big ass pan
2. Get that sizzling away. You want it to be like a gentle brown not burnt. Like a good tan.
3. You can add in some of the spice now if you like.
4. Chop your bacon & put it in. Do not be afraid of putting in too much bacon. 
5. Chop your chicken and put it in. Thighs are better but ugh you can use breast if you must.
6. Fry it all up what good for.
7. Sprinkle some flour over it all and mix it in so it's not lumpy & gross but show some hustle so it doesn't burn.
8. Pour the chicken stock in.
9. I like to pre-cook the potato ( and/or squash) in the microwave but if you can be fucked roasting them that is pretty lush. Just make them big & chop them after they've cooled down. Some mush into the soup it is orgasmic.
10. Keep adding 'erbs and salt and pepper, tasting as you go.
11. Chuck the corn in. Creamed is best but you'll survive without.
12. Simmer.
13. Stir.
14. Turn off the heat and once the bubbles are gone stir in the cream.
15. Eat with garlic bread and convince yourself that all soup is healthy probably.

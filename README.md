3. Garlic
4. Onion
5. Dried Chillies
6. Mixed Herbs
7. Chicken stock
8. Cream
9. Flour
10. Creamed corn 
11. Squash and/potato/or whatever root veges you fancy (lol root)

### Steps

1. Mince your garlic & Onion, biff in your big ass pan
2. Get that sizzling away. You want it to be like a gentle brown not burnt. Like a good tan.
3. You can add in some of the spice now if you like.
4. Chop your bacon & put it in. Do not be afraid of putting in too much bacon. 
5. Chop your chicken and put it in. Thighs are better but ugh you can use breast if you must.
6. Fry it all up what good for.
7. Sprinkle some flour over it all and mix it in so it's not lumpy & gross but show some hustle so it doesn't burn.
8. Pour the chicken stock in.
9. I like to pre-cook the potato ( and/or squash) in the microwave but if you can be fucked roasting them that is pretty lush. Just make them big & chop them after they've cooled down. Some mush into the soup it is orgasmic.
10. Keep adding 'erbs and salt and pepper, tasting as you go.
11. Chuck the corn in. Creamed is best but you'll survive without.
12. Simmer.
13. Stir.
14. Turn off the heat and once the bubbles are gone stir in the cream.
15. Eat with garlic bread and convince yourself that all soup is healthy probably.

## Vegetarian Lasagne

### Ingredients

1. Onion
2. Garlic
3. Pastry Sheets
4. Cheese
5. Flour
6. Milk
7. Tinned Tomatoes
8. Tomato Passatta
9. Spinnach
10. Carrots
11. Squash
12. Potatoes
13. Zucchini
14. Broccoli
15. Cauliflower
16. Worchestor Sauce
17. Salt & Pepper
18. Rosemary
19. oil

### Steps

1. Fry up garlic & Onions in oil
2. Pre-cook Potatoes, squash; broccoli, cauliflower in the microwave (a bit cooked)
3. Pop the pre cooked veges in the wok with the onions & garlic.
4. As soon as it starts sticking a teensy bit (you've used up all the oil from the start with the garlic) pop in the tinned tomato
5. Stir it all up and keep it cooking. Let the tomato reduce a little bit so it isn't too much liquid. Then pour in the passatta. 
If it's homemade you probably don't need to add anything apart from the salt & pepper. Otherwise add herbs to taste. Leave that on low to medium heat to cook through.
6. Turn the oven on to heat up.
7. Melt some butter in a seperate pan. Sprinkle in flour.
8. Add milk SLOWWWWLY. Whisk it in if you've got one handy. Otherwise just take it into a bowl & fork the fuck out of it.
9. Pop some cheese in and stir til it melts. Get it all gooey & cheesy & lussshh.
10. Turn the heat off and pop the baby spinach in. Stir it through. 
11. Chuck your first layer of the vege mix down in your dish.
12. Layer with the lasagne sheets and cheese sauce. Grate some more cheese on (My mum pops cottage or riccotta cheese on this bit too).
13. Pour more veges on top of that and another cheese sauce layer. Because you're doing veges it can be tricky to get heaps of layers in the pan. 
If you do three, I'm proud of you. Grate heaps of cheese on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
14. Make sure your lasagne sheets are all covered in runny sauce though because otherwise it'll stay dry and be a bitch to eat.
15. Put it in the oven and make sure it is all gold on top when you take it out so nobody could possibly deny your culinary excellence.
